			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			 <li>
				 <b>Coaching</b>. I am currently an assistant swim coach at my Alma Mater Cedar Crest High School. 
			 </li>
			  <li>
				<b>Reviving Old Computers</b>. One of my favorite things to do with old computers is seeing the difference that some new parts and a new operating system can make in a computers performance. 
			 </li>
			 <li>
				<b>Linux</b>. I started using Linux at the beginning of my junior year of college and I've been in love ever since. I currently use Manjaro on a Thinkpad T440 as my main machine. 
			 </li>
			 <li>
				<b>Fishing</b>. Nothing technical or special about it, I just enjoy it and I am not a robot that does nothing but computeres 24/7 ;)

			  <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
  			<li>
		  Home Price Predictor in Python - I recently completed an independent study for my school where I chose to explore different machine learning algorithms to see how accurate they can be 
		  when it comes to predicting home prices based on a given set of data. I found that K-Nearest Neighbors worked very well with my data set, and my implementation 
		  was given ranges of prices of houses and could place a house in the correct price range with a consistent %90+ accuracy.
			</li>
			<li>
			Java Text Based Web Adventure Game - For my Software Engineering class I worked with 2 other students to create a text based web application adventure game in Java. I was in charge of implementing all the classes my teammates created
			into a functioning game with a user friendly front end. 
		</li>
		  <li>
			Cryptocurrency Price Predictor - For our senior design project, myself and 2 other students collaborated to create a desktop app in Python that uses third party API calls to collect cryptocurrency data and visualize and predict how the price has 
			  changed overtime and where it is predicted to go in the near future. My role in this project was to use the third party API calls to collect data from cryptocompare, and store the data in Airtable so that it may be easily accessed later by my teammates. 
		  </li>
		</ul>
  		    <h3>Current Projects </h3>
  		   <ul>
			   <li>CompTIA Linux+ - I am currently studying to take the CompTIA Linux+ exam and become certified.
			   </li>
  			<li>
           Repurposing old workstations into a functioning home server - I was given a few old PCs from work that were to be recycled so I am currently working on reusing parts from each PC to create one (hopefully soon) working Ubuntu home server for little to no cost.
            </li>
		    <li>
		   Instaram Automation Bot in Python - I took some source code for an open source Instagram bot and I am currently working on adding onto it so that the bot will behave more randomly as to not trigger any Instagram bot filters. I also plan on adding automated posting in the near future. 
		   Ideally I would be able to run this bot on my repurposed home server one day.
